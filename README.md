# Plugin Details
In this Video, I'm presenting a NEW FREE Plugin for Cinema 4D. It's written in Python, is Open Source and allows you to create Splines from Polygon Edges, just like the "Edge to Spline" Command, but non destructively. It's called... wait for it: "Edge to Spline".

Installation: Download and Unzip the "edgeToSpline.zip" archive, and the resulting "edgeToSpline" Folder, copy it into the Plugins Folder of Cinema 4D in the application Root Folder. If you don't have a plugins folder, then just make one and name it "plugins". Restart C4D. If you have no idea what I'm talking about... forget it.

You can use it commercially, or not use it at all... either way we accept NO RESPONSIBILITY for any issues you may have using this plugin, including but not limited to: procrastination, computer damage, loss of income, extensive accumulation of wealth, or bad habits. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK... it's Free.
